## **Introduction**

The following report will discuss the obtained results for the Basics of Mobile Robotics project. The objective of the project is to code a fully functional robot with the following specifics, a vision module to interpret and transcribe an environment for the robot to move in, and to continously track the position of the robot, a global navigation module to calculate the optimal path for the robot to reach its goal, a local navigation module to detect and avoid obstacles at any moment, a filtering unit that estimates the position of the robot depending on certain parameters, and lastly related to all of it is a control section to manage the movements and direction of the robot.

The entrance to a new tomb was recently discovered in the Valley of the Kings. Hundreds of Egyptologists have been trying to discover the secrets contained within the place but to no avail. What they don't know is that excavation Group 36 managed to get their hands on the map of the burried labyrinth. Unfortunately, the entrance to the sarcophagus room is too small for a human to fit. Furthermore, the old age of the structure leads to bricks falling from the roof which is quite dangerous for the explorers. The group thus decided to use a robot to further explore the insides and maybe discover the greatest Egyptian treasure yet.
